HELPFUL TIPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ Create 5-10 posts in advance so you don't scramble daily

✓ Schedule posts with future dates - they'll appear automatically

✓ Share each post to Reddit (r/Yiddish), Twitter, Facebook

✓ Check analytics after 1 month to see what's working

✓ Be patient - growth takes 3-6 months
