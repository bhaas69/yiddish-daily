## ‚úâÔ∏è Setting Up Email Signup

The homepage has an email signup form ready to go. You need to connect it to an email service:

### Option A: Buttondown (Recommended - Free tier available)

1. Go to https://buttondown.email
2. Sign up for free account
3. Get your signup form URL
4. Edit `index.html` and replace this line:
   ```html
   <form class="email-form" action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/yiddish-daily" method="post">
   ```
   With your actual Buttondown URL

### Option B: Mailchimp (Also good)

1. Sign up at https://mailchimp.com
2. Create an audience
3. Get the embedded form code
4. Replace the form in `index.html` with Mailchimp's code

### Email Automation

Once you have subscribers, you can auto-send daily posts:
- **Buttondown**: Has built-in RSS-to-email (just point it to your feed.xml)
- **Mailchimp**: Use RSS Campaign feature
- **Schedule**: Set to send daily at 8am (or whenever you prefer)

Your RSS feed is automatically available at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/yiddish-daily/feed.xml`

## üé® Customization

### Change Site Title/Description

Edit `_config.yml`:
```yaml
title: Your Title
description: Your tagline
```

### Change Colors

Edit `assets/css/style.css` - main colors to change:
- `#2c3e50` - Dark blue (header background)
- `#3498db` - Bright blue (links, buttons)
- `#fff` - White (text on dark)

### Add Your Own Domain (Optional)

1. Buy a domain (Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)
2. In your repo, create a file named `CNAME` with just your domain:
   ```
   yiddishdaily.com
   ```
3. Point your domain's DNS to GitHub Pages (instructions from your domain provider)

---

## üîß Local Development (Optional)

If you want to preview changes before pushing to GitHub:

### Install Jekyll

```bash
# Install Ruby (if you don't have it)
# Then install Jekyll:
gem install bundler jekyll

# Navigate to your site folder:
cd yiddish-daily

# Install dependencies:
bundle install

# Run the site locally:
bundle exec jekyll serve

# View at: http://localhost:4000
```

Now you can edit files and see changes instantly!

## üìä Adding Analytics (Optional)

### Google Analytics

1. Sign up at https://analytics.google.com
2. Get your tracking ID
3. Add to `_layouts/default.html` before `</head>`:
   ```html
   <!-- Google Analytics -->
   <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOUR-ID"></script>
   <script>
     window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
     function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
     gtag('js', new Date());
     gtag('config', 'YOUR-ID');
   </script>
   ```

---

## üí∞ Adding Ads (When You're Ready)

### Google AdSense

1. Apply at https://www.google.com/adsense
2. Wait for approval (need some traffic first)
3. Add ad code to `_layouts/post.html` or `_layouts/default.html`

**Realistic timeline:**
- Months 1-3: Build content, no ads yet
- Months 4-6: Apply for AdSense
- Month 6+: Start earning (slowly at first)

## üéØ Content Strategy Tips

### To Grow Your Audience:

1. **Post consistently**: Daily is ideal, but start with 3x/week if needed
2. **Be genuinely interesting**: Share discoveries YOU find fascinating
3. **Keep it digestible**: 200-500 words is perfect for daily content
4. **Great images**: Visual content gets shared more
5. **Share everywhere**: Reddit (r/Yiddish), Twitter, Facebook groups
6. **Build email list**: That's where the value is long-term

### Content Ideas:

- Vintage advertisements (like your Coca-Cola ad!)
- Newspaper clippings with surprising stories
- Yiddish words with no English equivalent
- Photos of Yiddish signage
- Quotes from Yiddish literature/poetry
- Historical facts about Yiddish culture
- Yiddish music discoveries
- Famous Yiddish speakers
- Yiddish theater posters
- Letters, documents, menus
